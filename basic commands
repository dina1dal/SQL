#Normalization notes
1NF:
-All attributes are atomic/single (No multivalued attribute, no composite attribute, values in the same attribute should be of the same type)

2NF:
Has to be in the 1NF
There is no partial dependency (non-prime attribute should not be dependent on one part of the primary key without the other part/s)

3NF:
Has to be in the 2NF
There is no transitive dependency
(transitive dependency is when a non-prime attribute is dependent on another non-prime attribute)
